*Release Date*: May 30, 2025 +
*Status*: Beta

== What's New

=== Enhanced Error Handling
* *Improved Try-Catch-Finally Mechanism*: More robust exception handling with proper cleanup
* *Better Error Reporting*: More descriptive error messages with line and column information
* *Nested Exception Support*: Properly handle exceptions within exception handlers
* *Resource Management*: Guaranteed resource cleanup with finally blocks

=== Library System Improvements
* *Optimized Library Loading*: Faster import times for commonly used libraries
* *Enhanced StrLib Functions*: More powerful string manipulation capabilities
* *TimeLib Integration*: Comprehensive date and time handling through the TimeLib interface

== Removed Features

=== String-Related Tokens
Based on community feedback and code reviews on Reddit, we've removed redundant tokens to make the language more streamlined and efficient:

* *Removed `Text` Token*: String data storage is now handled by built-in operators and StrLib
* *Removed `Concat` Token*: String joining is now handled through the `+` operator and StrLib[join]
* *Removed `Slice` Token*: Substring extraction is now handled through StrLib[substring]
* *Removed `Len` Token*: String length is now accessed through StrLib[length]

=== Date & Time Tokens
* *Removed `Current` Token*: Current date/time is now handled through TimeLib[now]
* *Removed `Now` Token*: Current timestamp is now handled through TimeLib[timestamp]
* *Removed `Year` Token*: Year extraction is now handled through TimeLib[year]
* *Removed `Month` Token*: Month extraction is now handled through TimeLib[month]
* *Removed `Day` Token*: Day extraction is now handled through TimeLib[day]
* *Removed `Hour` Token*: Hour extraction is now handled through TimeLib[hour]
* *Removed `Minute` Token*: Minute extraction is now handled through TimeLib[minute]
* *Removed `Second` Token*: Second extraction is now handled through TimeLib[second]

=== Reasons for Removal
* *Community Feedback*: Users found these tokens redundant and confusing
* *Library Integration*: TimeLib and StrLib provide more comprehensive functionality
* *Simplification*: Reduces cognitive load by using consistent operators
* *Performance*: Removes unnecessary token parsing overhead
* *Maintainability*: Simplifies the codebase and reduces potential bugs

== Technical Improvements

=== Parser Updates
* *Simplified Token Registration*: Removed redundant token registrations
* *Streamlined Type Checking*: Removed specialized type checking for date/time values
* *Enhanced Error Messages*: More consistent error reporting for variable declarations

=== Code Cleanup
* *Removed Redundant Display Formatting*: Simplified the `fmt::Display` implementation
* *Removed Redundant Token Mappings*: Simplified the `lookup_ident` function
* *Added Clarifying Comments*: Added comments to indicate that operations are now handled by libraries

== Documentation Updates

=== Updated Examples
All examples using the removed tokens have been updated to use the new approach.
New examples demonstrate the preferred way to handle string and date/time operations.

=== Migration Guide
If you were using the removed tokens, here's how to migrate:

.String Operations
[source,razen]
----
# Import required libraries
lib strlib;

# Old way
text greeting = "Welcome to Razen";
concat fullName = "John" + " " + "Doe";
slice firstName = "John Doe"[0:4];
len nameLength = "John Doe".length;

# New way
take greeting = "Welcome to Razen";
take fullName = "John" + " " + "Doe";
take firstName = StrLib[substring]("John Doe", 0, 4);
take nameLength = StrLib[length]("John Doe");
----

.Date & Time Operations
[source,razen]
----
# Import required libraries
lib timelib;

# Old way
current currentTime = now();
year currentYear = currentTime.year;
month currentMonth = currentTime.month;

# New way
let currentTime = TimeLib[now]();
let currentYear = TimeLib[year](currentTime);
let currentMonth = TimeLib[month](currentTime);
----

.Error Handling Improvements
[source,razen]
----
# Enhanced try-catch-finally example
try {
    # Code that might throw an exception
    let numbers = [1, 2, 3];
    let value = numbers[5]; # This will throw an exception
} catch (error) {
    # Handle the exception
    show "Error occurred: " + error;
} finally {
    # This block always executes
    show "Cleanup operations complete";
}
----

== Future Plans
* Further streamlining of redundant tokens
* Enhanced library support for common operations
* Performance optimizations for string and date/time operations

== Acknowledgements
Thanks to the Razen community for their valuable feedback and suggestions that led to these improvements.
