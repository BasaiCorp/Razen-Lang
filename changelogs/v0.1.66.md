# Razen v0.1.66 - File System Library Update

**Release Date**: May 18, 2025  
**Status**: Beta  

## What's New

### File System Library (Beta)
We're excited to introduce the new **File System** library! This update brings essential file and directory operations to Razen.

### Working Features

#### File Operations
- `Filesystem[exists](path)` - Check if a file/directory exists at the given path
  - `path` (string): Path to check
  - Returns: `true` if exists, `false` otherwise

- `Filesystem[write_file](path, content, append)` - Write content to a file
  - `path` (string): File path to write to
  - `content` (string): Content to write
  - `append` (boolean): If `true`, append to file; if `false`, overwrite file
  - Returns: `true` on success

- `Filesystem[read_file](path)` - Read entire file contents
  - `path` (string): Path to file to read
  - Returns: File contents as string

- `Filesystem[copy](source, destination)` - Copy a file
  - `source` (string): Path to source file
  - `destination` (string): Path to destination file
  - Returns: `true` on success

- `Filesystem[move](source, destination)` - Move/rename a file or directory
  - `source` (string): Current path
  - `destination` (string): New path
  - Returns: `true` on success

- `Filesystem[remove](path)` - Delete a file or directory
  - `path` (string): Path to file or directory to remove
  - Returns: `true` on success

- `Filesystem[is_file](path)` - Check if path is a file
  - `path` (string): Path to check
  - Returns: `true` if path is a file

- `Filesystem[extension](path)` - Get file extension
  - `path` (string): File path
  - Returns: File extension (e.g., "txt" for "file.txt")

- `Filesystem[file_stem](path)` - Get filename without extension
  - `path` (string): File path
  - Returns: Filename without extension (e.g., "file" for "file.txt")

### Directory Operations
- `Filesystem[create_dir](path)` - Create new directory
  - `path` (string): Directory path to create
  - Returns: `true` on success

- `Filesystem[is_dir](path)` - Check if path is a directory
  - `path` (string): Path to check
  - Returns: `true` if path is a directory

- `Filesystem[list_dir](path)` - List directory contents
  - `path` (string): Directory path
  - Returns: Array of directory entries as strings

- `Filesystem[parent_dir](path)` - Get parent directory
  - `path` (string): File or directory path
  - Returns: Parent directory path

### Path Utilities
- `Filesystem[current_dir]()` - Get current working directory
  - Returns: Current working directory as string

- `Filesystem[absolute_path](path)` - Convert path to absolute path
  - `path` (string): Relative or absolute path
  - Returns: Absolute path as string

- `Filesystem[join_path](path_components)` - Join path components
  - `path_components` (array): Array of path components
  - Returns: Joined path as string

### Known Issues
- **Path Variables**: Currently, variables in file/directory paths are not supported. You must use direct string paths.
  ```Razen
  # Works:
  Filesystem[read_file]("path/to/file.txt")
  
  # Doesn't work yet:
  take path = "path/to/file.txt"
  Filesystem[read_file](path)
  ```

- **Working Values**: Variables can be used for file content and function parameters, just not in path strings.

### Coming Soon
- Support for variables in file paths
- More file system operations
- Improved error handling and reporting
