# Define a greeting variable
# NOTE: Global variables like this outside main execution are tricky.
# num's var definitions inside functions or the main flow for now.
# num greeting = "Hello"; # Moved inside say_hello for simplicity now

# Define function to say hello
fun say_hello(name) {
    num greeting = "Hello"; # Define locally for now
    # String concatenation not yet supported, showing parts separately
    show greeting;
    show ", "; # Show literal string

# Define function to calculate the sum of two numbers
fun calculate_sum(a, b) {

# Main execution part (implicitly runs in the compiled 'main' function)
num person = "World"; # String variable
say_hello(person); # Call function

num num1 = 10;
num num2 = 5;
num total = calculate_sum(num1, num2); # Call function, result in 'total'

# Show the sum result
