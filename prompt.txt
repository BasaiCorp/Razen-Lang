The install.sh has some issues with downlaoding right files.
it will first check and find these folders and their files from github repo.
for this it will make do git clone in a temorary or any folder where razen stores. andthe cloning it will copy/downlaod these folder's and files to the main razen folder.
/src folder and it's files
/src/functions folder and it's files
/properties folder and it's files
/properties/libs folder and it's files
/scripts folder and it's files
/examples folder and it's files
/docs folder and it's files
Cargo.toml files

also show that which all files are detected.

and show a message that all files are downloaded successfully.
and also show a downloded log for each file.

and the in the scripts folder it will make all scripts executable and make symbolic links for them all as their name.

and tehn it will detect the rust is installed or not and make sure proeprly detect.

and then go to folder where these files downlaoded and then run the cargo build command.
and after it build successfully, it will show a message that all files are built successfully.

and the install.sh is good but need to update it.

and then it will show a message that all files are installed successfully.

this way we get perfect one and no error becuase we will directly colne first github repo and then copy all files to the main razen folder.
