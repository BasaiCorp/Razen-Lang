# Razen Error Handling System Analysis

This document analyzes the current state of error handling in Razen and proposes improvements based on testing and comparison with error handling in other programming languages.

## What's Working

1. **Basic Try-Catch-Finally Structure**
   - The basic syntax for try-catch-finally blocks is implemented
   - Errors are caught and control is transferred to catch blocks
   - Finally blocks execute regardless of whether an error occurred

2. **Error Propagation**
   - Errors thrown in functions are properly propagated to calling code
   - Errors can be caught at different levels of the call stack

3. **Custom Error Messages**
   - The `throw` keyword works for throwing custom string error messages
   - These messages can be caught in catch blocks

4. **Library Error Integration**
   - Errors from library functions (like division by zero in MathLib) are caught by try-catch

5. **Nested Try-Catch Blocks**
   - Inner try-catch blocks can catch errors and re-throw them to outer blocks
   - Inner finally blocks execute before outer catch blocks

## What's Not Working

1. **Error Object Information**
   - Errors are represented as `true` boolean values in catch blocks instead of actual error messages
   - Example: `Caught error: true` instead of `Caught error: Division by zero`
   - No error type, line number, or stack trace information is provided

2. **Error Propagation Within Try Blocks**
   - After the first error in a try block, execution continues instead of jumping to the catch block
   - Example: In Example 2, after the array index error, the code continues to the division by zero
   - This is a critical issue as it defeats the purpose of try-catch for error recovery

3. **Complex Data in Errors**
   - Limited support for throwing and catching complex data structures as errors
   - No proper error object system with properties like type, message, code, etc.

4. **Try-Finally Without Catch**
   - No support for try-finally blocks without a catch block
   - Many languages allow try-finally for cleanup operations even without error handling

5. **Array Operations in Error Handling**
   - Limited support for array operations within try-catch blocks
   - Cannot reliably store results or errors in arrays during error handling

## Improvement Opportunities

1. **Rich Error Objects**
   - Implement proper error objects with properties:
     - `message`: Descriptive error message
     - `type`: Error type (e.g., TypeError, RangeError)
     - `line`: Line number where the error occurred
     - `stack`: Call stack at the time of the error
   - Example: `throw new Error("Division by zero", "ArithmeticError", 42)`

2. **Fix Error Propagation**
   - Ensure execution immediately jumps to the catch block after the first error
   - Properly unwind the stack when an error occurs

3. **Type-Based Error Catching**
   - Add support for catching specific error types:
     ```
     try {
       // code that might throw different types of errors
     } catch (TypeError error) {
       // handle type errors
     } catch (RangeError error) {
       // handle range errors
     } catch (error) {
       // handle all other errors
     }
     ```

4. **Try-Finally Support**
   - Add support for try-finally blocks without a catch block:
     ```
     try {
       // code that needs cleanup but where errors aren't handled
     } finally {
       // cleanup code
     }
     ```

5. **Improved Array and Object Support**
   - Better support for array and object operations in error handling
   - Allow storing and retrieving error information in data structures

6. **Async Error Handling**
   - If Razen adds asynchronous programming support, implement async error handling
   - Support for async/await with try-catch or Promise-like .catch() methods

7. **Stack Traces**
   - Implement stack traces for errors to aid debugging
   - Include function names, line numbers, and file information

8. **Error Chaining**
   - Support for error chaining to preserve the original error when re-throwing:
     ```
     try {
       // code that might throw
     } catch (error) {
       throw new Error("Wrapper error", error); // Chain the original error
     }
     ```

9. **Custom Error Types**
   - Allow defining custom error types for domain-specific error handling:
     ```
     type ValidationError extends Error {
       field: string;
       code: number;
     }
     ```

10. **Error Recovery Utilities**
    - Add utilities for common error recovery patterns
    - Example: `tryOr(risky_function, default_value)` to return a default on error

## Implementation Priority

1. **Critical Fixes**
   - Fix error propagation within try blocks
   - Implement proper error objects with messages instead of boolean values

2. **High Priority**
   - Add stack traces for debugging
   - Support try-finally without catch
   - Fix array operations in error handling

3. **Medium Priority**
   - Implement type-based error catching
   - Add error chaining support
   - Create custom error types

4. **Future Enhancements**
   - Async error handling
   - Error recovery utilities
   - Advanced debugging features

## Conclusion

The current error handling system in Razen provides basic functionality but has significant limitations compared to error handling in modern programming languages. Implementing the improvements outlined above would greatly enhance Razen's error handling capabilities, making it more robust and developer-friendly.

By prioritizing these improvements, Razen can offer a more complete and reliable error handling system that meets the expectations of developers familiar with other languages while maintaining Razen's unique design philosophy.
