# Razen Time Library
# Provides time utilities for the Razen language.
# Usage: import lib time;
#        let timestamp = Time.now();
#        Time.sleep(2);

class Time {
    # Returns the current timestamp (seconds since epoch).
    # Example: Time.now() => 1681552287
    static now() {
        return Date.timestamp();
    }

    # Pauses execution for the given number of seconds.
    # Example: Time.sleep(1) => pauses for 1 second
    static sleep(seconds) {
        # Implementation depends on the runtime support
        # This is a placeholder that will need runtime support
        return 0;
    }
}

# Example Usage:
# import lib time;
# let timestamp = Time.now();
# Time.sleep(1);
# let new_timestamp = Time.now();
# show "Time difference: " + (new_timestamp - timestamp);

# Integration Notes:
# - Import with: import lib time;
# - Call methods as Time.method(...)
# - Compatible with Razen parser, lexer, and compiler.
